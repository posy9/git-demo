Fuck your dreams I'm worried about ours
I will never go back to crowbars to cars
You could walk a million yellow bricks never reach oz
You could part the clouds never see God
Metaphor to trying too hard to reach Bones
Except I'm really here bring fear to your home
Me I always hear like my ear to the phone
So listen for the static Imma warn you in code
Think you will understand if you see me up close no
You can never truly know a ghost.
